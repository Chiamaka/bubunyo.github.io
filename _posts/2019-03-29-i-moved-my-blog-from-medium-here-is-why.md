When I first got introduced to medium in 2016, it was love at first sight. The idea was simple. Write you thoughs using the best web editor I had experienced as yet, and read the thoughts of others. Nothing complicated. I wasnt the only one who fell in love. [1.9 million posts were created on Medium at the end of 2015. By the end of 2016 that number had trippled](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/medium-top-stories/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds). And with that came a new funding round of $50 million. And that is where a lot of their problems started.

In other to explain where the problems started i need to explain how VC funding works. If you already know how vc funding works, please feel free to skip this paragraph. When VC's give you money, they dont expect dividends, at the end of the month or year. They expect returns when you exit. An exit will happen when you IPO or get acquired for multiples more than you are actually worth. That is when they cash out. Returns for VC's are expected in the a magnitude of more than 5x plus. So if a VC gives you $50 million, on the average, you are supposed to make him about $ 250 million in about 5 years. But it gets tricky. In other to be abel to make a return of $250 million for an investor who has about a 30% stake in your business, you are going to have to sell your company for $800 million dollars.

So the bottom line is medium needs to generate revenue.
