At DevCongress one of our main events is the quaterly meetups we "try" to organize. If you havnt been to one before, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNWWGWXjybg) will tell you all about it. As the community grows, management of the community grows, with it, and the task of organising events becomes ever more difficult. For a very long time we the administrators have single handed funded most of these events but we think the time has come to scale funding for this events to make them bigger, make them representative, and increas the quality of the content and what you can take away from it. So we have decided to launch a DevCongress Design Challenge. 

####The Aim

The main aim of the challenge is to creating branding material that we can use to show our support for the community and to generate some income to run our jobs board and future events. 

####The Challenge

The challenge is going to be a simple design challenge. We are looking for designs of T-shirts and Laptop stickers. The criteria of the designs should be as follows; 

* They should be fun, interesting, thought provoking and nice. 
* It should include a DevCongress branding of some sort. 
* It should include the signature of the designer for attribution.
* You can use any DevCongress brand items, including the logos and ananse. 

What it should not be. 

* Be insensitive, include bigotted or sensitive remarks. 
* It should not include any coporate brnading of any sort. 
* Dont steal someone elses work
